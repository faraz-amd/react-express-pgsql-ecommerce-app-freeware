## Regular Setup

 ### Cloning + Installing Packages

  - Clone this repo with one of these options:

    - Click the 'Use this template' button at the top of the page
    - Via the command line:
       ```shell
       git clone [https://github.com/netlify-templates/gatsby-ecommerce-theme/](https://github.com/netlify-templates/gatsby-ecommerce-theme/)
       ```
    - Or you can clone the theme straight from the Netlify CLI, using the `netlify sites:create-template` command in your terminal ([learn more about this command here](https://www.netlify.com/blog/create-a-site-from-a-template-using-the-netlify-cli)) to do the entire flow for you.

  From there, you can install the project's dependencies by running:

  npm install or yarn install
